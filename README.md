# RAG based RecSys using LLMs

This work presents a real-time product recommendation system based on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, designed to engage users with insightful recommendations. The system leverages the **ChromaDB** vector database, supported with the **BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5** model, and employs a RAG-integrated **LangChain** pipeline for advanced semantic search. Powered by the open-source **LLama-3.1-70b-instruct model**, this solution is deployed as a **Streamlit API**, enabling efficient and interactive querying.
